# 001_sklearn_wine
python 3.10.9

This will be part 1 of the 100 machine learning projects in 40 days challenge.

Starting with an easy build, we are just looking at something that I see a lot,
but truth be told, have never tried. I learned ML in sklearn, so this will be a nice refresher.

Steps:
Set up environment
Import libraries and modules
Load data
Split data into train/test
Declare pre-processing steps
Tune model using cross-validation pipeline.
Refit on the entire training set.
Evaluate on testing set.

Save model for further use.

A quick wine_rating model, the final output is a model that can predict wine ratings when given some wine features.
